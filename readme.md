### Inspiration
As a gateway into the world of graphics-powered apps and websites, I decided to learn Three.js to create cool stuff.

### What did I learn? [ABOUT PROGRAMMING]
- Super cool stuff with Three.js 
- What is WebGL and its' usages
- Rendering on Demand
- Debugging GLSL
- Animating a 3D object on hover/scroll
- The infinite possibilities yielded by manipulating the DOM 

### What did I learn? [ABOUT WRITING SOFTWARE]
- Use comments sparingly. Though I was tempted to use descriptive comments on code blocks, I often mislabeled concepts since Three.js is relatively new to me. A better route is to find ways to write simpler code that's easier to understand
